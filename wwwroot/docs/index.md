# Getting Started

This guide will walk through installing and setting up TKMM.

To learn how to install and merge mods, check out the [Using Mods](./using-mods/) guide.

## Installation

On the [downloads](../downloads) page, locate and download the <kbd><samp>TKMM</samp></kbd> zip file for your operating system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since data for installed mods is stored in the same folder as the executable, it's strongly recommended to place the executable where you'd like it to stay prior to completing the setup wizard. 


Once the download has completed, extract the **TKMM** zip file and run the contained executable. The following window will open.

Follow the setup wizard to configure the game dump and language for TKMM. 

> [!NOTE]
> TKMM will output mods for the same version as the provided game dump.
>
> For example, if you are playing on `v1.1.2`, make sure your game dump is for `v1.1.2` as well.
> Multiple game dump versions can be provided, and you can choose which version to output mods for from the Settings tab.

Once finished, you will land on the mods tab as shown below.
