# Getting Started

This guide will walk through installing and setting up TKMM.

To learn how to install and merge mods, check out the [Using Mods](./using-mods/) guide.

## Installation

On the [downloads](../downloads) page, locate and download the <kbd><samp>TKMM Launcher</samp></kbd> and <kbd><samp>.NET Runtime</samp></kbd> for your operating system.

When the downloads have completed, open the **.NET Runtime** installer and follow the prompts to completion.

Click <kbd><samp>Install</samp></kbd> to begin the installation process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The TKMM installer requires a stable internet connection.

When the installation completes, click <kbd><samp>Launch</samp></kbd> to open TKMM.

## Setup

When TKMM first starts, you will most likely be asked to configure your game path.

</p>

This field contains the path to your Tears of the Kingdom romfs game dump.

If you do not already have the game dump on your computer, please follow [this guide](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Help:Dumping_games#Switch) to legally obtain one.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When dumping your copy of the game, make sure you include the `1.1.0` update or later. `1.0.0` is [not supported by TKMM](/faq/#why-cant-i-use-version-100).

<p>
    <img width="650" src="./images/(1.4)-InvalidGameVersion.png" alt="Invalid Empty Game Path">
</p>

Once you have dumped your copy of the game to romfs, use the <kbd><samp>...</samp></kbd> button to browse to it's location.

When the game path is set correctly the field will turn green.

> [!NOTE]
> TKMM will output mods for the same version as the provided game dump.
>
> For example, if you are playing on `v1.1.2`, make sure your game dump is for `v1.1.2` as well.
