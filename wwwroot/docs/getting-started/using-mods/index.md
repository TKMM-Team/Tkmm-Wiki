# Mods

This page will guide you on how to install mods, configure options for mods, and manage mod profiles.

## Installing Mods
You can install mods from a file archive, a folder, or from TKMM's built-in GameBanana tab.

### Installing Mods From An Archive
TKMM supports installing mods from several archive types, including `rar`, `zip`, `7z`, and a custom format, `TKCL`. The first three are generic archive types that you may already be familiar with from using mods. `TKCL` files are produced by developers using TKMM, and are the best option when available, since they were specifically designed for use in TKMM. To install a mod from a file, you can drag and drop the file onto the homepage of TKMM, or locate it in your computer's files by choosing `Install File` in the `Mod` dropdown at the top of the screen. If your active profile already has at least one mod installed, you can click on the Install button at the bottom of the mod list. Additionally, the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + I` will prompt you to select a file to install a mod from.

### Installing Mods From A Folder
TKMM supports installing a mod from a folder, provided it has the correct structure. The folder must only contain in it a romfs and/or exefs folder, and any files added using the packaging tab. To install a mod from a folder, you can drag and drop the folder onto the homepage of TKMM, or locate it in your computer's file system by choosing `Install Folder` in the `Mod` dropdown at the top of the screen. Additionally, the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + I` will prompt you to select a folder to install a mod from. This is the recommended method for mod developers who want to be able to quickly test their mod without having to package it.
