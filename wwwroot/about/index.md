# About

TKMM stands for **T**ears of the **K**ingdom **M**od **M**anager. It aims to be an all in one mod manager and merger for Tears of the Kingdom.

The project was originally founded by **[Aster](https://github.com/AsteroidPizza39)** and **[The5thTear](https://github.com/The5thTear)** with the intention of simplifying the tedious process of merging multiple Tears of the Kingdom mods.

TKMM is now maintained and developed by [TKMM-Team](#the-team).
