## Mod Merging

TKMM integrates with multiple mod merging tools to support the seamless combination of various file types.

### Current Supported File Types

* **ResourceSizeTable** [LordBubbles's](https://github.com/MasterBubbles) branch of [dt12345]()'s restbl tool has been curated for maximum efficiency, and convienience!
* **RSDB** *(Tag.Product, PouchActorInfo, GameActorInfo, etc.)* inspired by [Legend5v's](https://gamebanana.com/members/2731522)'s original code, [Lord Bubbles's](https://github.com/MasterBubbles) [RSDB merger](https://github.com/MasterBubbles/rsdb-merge) is easy to use, and very efficient.
* **Localization (Mals)** created by [Arch Leaders](https://github.com/ArchLeaders), his [MalsMerger](https://github.com/ArchLeaders/MalsMerger) is lightning fast, ensuring you recieve your merged files as fast as possible.
* **SARC Archives (.pack)** created by [Mika](https://github.com/okmika), his [SARC and BYML Merger](https://github.com/okmika/TKMM-SARC) is fast, efficient, and well written.
* **BYML Files (.byml, .bgyml)**
* **ShopParam Exceptions** created by [Mika](https://github.com/okmika), [Bubbles](https://github.com/MasterBubbles), and [5th](https://github.com/The5thTear), the ShopParam handler will prevent errors in regards with too many shop entries, allowing users to order their overflow shops and keep their mods from breaking.
